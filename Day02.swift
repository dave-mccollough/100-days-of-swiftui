// Your goal is to write a Swift playground that:

// Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
let celsiusTemp = 32
// Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
let farenheitTemp = (celsiusTemp * 9 / 5) + 32
// Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.
print("Celsius temperature is \(celsiusTemp)°C and farenheit temperature is \(farenheitTemp)°F")
